## The Fetch and Execute Cycle
### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- "Brain" of the computer.
- Responsible for carrying out instructions of a program.
- Consists of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, and various registeres (memory caches).
### Program
- A list of unambiguous instrucions followed by a computer.
### Machine Language
- A very simple language typically represented in binary, but also in hexadecimal.
- Programs must be translated to your computer's specific machine language in order to be executed.
### Random Access or "Main" Memory (RAM)
- Stores the program being executed, and its associated data.
- Consists of sequences of locations numbered with addresses.
- Each location holds a piece of data that the CPU can retrieve, or has space for the CPU to store data inside.
