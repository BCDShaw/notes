## The Fetch and Execute Cycle

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- "Brain" of the computer.
- Responsible for carrying out instructions of a program.
- Consists of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, and various registeres (memory caches).

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

- Part of the CPU that carries out arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction.

### Memory Caches (Registers)

- Holds data likely to be used soon, or repeatedly, by the CPU to allow quicker access
- There are typically 16 or 32 of these registers in a CPU.

### Program Counter

- A special purpose register in the CPU that keeps track of which instrucion is to be executed next in the program by storing its address.

### CPU Cores

- Each core in a CPU allows it to fetch and execute instructions at the same time.
- Essentially allowing multitasking.

### Program

- A list of unambiguous instrucions followed by a computer.

### Random Access or "Main" Memory (RAM)

- Stores the program being executed, and its associated data.
- Consists of sequences of locations numbered with addresses.
- Each location holds a piece of data that the CPU can retrieve, or has space for the CPU to store data inside.

### Machine Language

- A very simple language typically represented in binary, but also in hexadecimal.
- Programs must be translated to your computer's specific machine language in order to be executed.

### Transitors

- Tiny switches wired together as Boolean Logic Gates so that the output of one switch directly affects the output of the next.
- On or off status of these switches are easily represented by binary.
- Resulting pattern of these switches turned on or off determined by the program being executed, and results in the output you see on your display, or hear through your audio devices, etc.

### Binary

- How machine language is typically represented.
- Numerical notation with 2 as a base.
- Two possible digits being 0 and 1.

### Bit

- One binary digit.

### Byte

- A sequence of eight bits
- Each memory location holds one byte of data.

### Fetching

- When the CPU receives/reads an instruction stored in memory.

### Executing

- When the CPU carries out the fetched instruction.

### Fetch and Execute Cycle

- The repeated fetching and executing of unambiuous instructions that make up a program.
- Main purpose of the CPU.
