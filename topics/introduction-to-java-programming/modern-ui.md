## The Modern User Interface

### Command-Line Interface

- Essentially your "cmd", "Powershell", "Gitbash", etc.
- The window in which you type something to your computer and it types back a response.

### Graphical User Interface

- How the majority of people interact with modern computers.
- Consists of components that users interact with via input devises such as a mouse and keyboard.

#### GUI Components

- Windows, menus, buttons, scrollbars, textboxes, etc.
- Drawn on your display by the computer.
- Java can use all standard components across most platforms.
- There are three complete sets of GUI components for Java.

#### Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT)

- First of three GUI component sets for Java.
- Included with the original Java release, and as such was built into the programming language itself.

#### Swing

- Second of three GUI component sets for Java.
- Introduced with Java 1.2, it was made to improve on what AWT offered. 
- Also built into the programming language itself.
- Considered the standard for GUI creation for years.

#### JavaFX

- The final complete set of Java GUI components.
- Originally part of Java 8, but is now its own separate entity. As it is no longer part of the programming language itself, it is now a more complex to implement into your programs.
- Intended to be a modern replacement for Swing.

### Event Handlers

- A set of code or instructions that dictate how an event is handled by the program. 
- Similar to how device drivers have instructions for how the computer is to handle events from devices.
- Events can include clicking a mouse, typing on a keyboard, etc.

### How it Applies to OOP

- GUI components are oftend implemented as objects, organized into classes and subclasses.
- Java includes various predegined GUI classes, thus reinforcing the OOP standard.
- GUIs even appear as visual objects.
