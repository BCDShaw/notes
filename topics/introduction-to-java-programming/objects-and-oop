 
## Objects and Object Oriented Programming

### Software Engineering

- The discipline of designing programs.
- Programs must be functional and well-written to solve a problem and be executed properly.

### Structured and Top-Down Programming

- The primary approach to software engineering in the 1970s and 1980s.
- An incomplete technique.
- Involves breaking projects into smaller chunks, and then breaking those into even smaller chunks, until you have problems of manageable sizes that you can solve, and then combine to create a program.

#### Cons of Top-Down

- It is an incomplete method.
- Deals primarily with producing instructions: subroutines and control structures.
- Due to this data structures were set on the back burner.
- Code produced in this method was difficult to reuse in future projects that would benefit from similar solutions.

### Bottom-Up Design

- Involves starting with problems you already have chunks of code you can utilise to solve them with.
- Combined with Top-Down Programming for a more well-rounded approach.

### Module

- A chunk of code that can be reused for different projects.
- Should be well-defined and straight-forward, allowing it to be "plugged in" with ease.

### Information Hiding

- The act of organizing chunks of code into modules for future reusability.
- These modules primarily deal with data structures and subroutines.
- One of the most important aspoects of software engineering.

#### Pros of Information Hiding

- Hiding this data inside modules can help protect it and also makes it easier for programmers to utilise.

### Object-Oriented Programming

- An advanced and well-established form of information hiding.

### Object

- A module containing data structures and subroutines.
- An object contains an internal "state" and responds to "messages".

#### State

- The internal data contained within an object.

#### Messages

- Calls to the subroutine contained within an object.

#### Example:

Object: Mailing List.

State: List of names and addresses.

1. Message: add a name.
Response: Modifies state to reflect the change by adding the name.
2. Message: print data.
Response: Prints list of all names and addresses. 

### OOP Approach

1) Identify objects associated with each problem and their state.
2) Identify all messages those objects should respond to.

### Polymorphism

- How different objects react to the same message differently.

### Class

- Objects with the same data type that respond to messages the same way.
- Used as a template to create objects. If a problem requires a very similar solution, you can make minor changes to the class and declare a new subclass.
- Similarities do not automatically mean that objects are of the same class, however they may be subclasses of the same parent.

### Subclass

- Subclass are like children to other classes. They "inherit" properties from those classes, but can respond to messages differently.
- They maintain enough distinction to warrant their own classs separate from their parent and sibling classes.

### Inheritance

- How a subclass maintains some properies of its parent class.
