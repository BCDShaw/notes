## The Internet and Beyond

### Network

- Two or more computers link together whether through a wired or wireless connection.
- Allows for communication between computers on the same network, such as exchanging data, files, messages, etc.

### Internet

- The largest network of computers and the most commonly used.
- Used by millions of people on millions of computers daily to access media, data, games, programs, and more via the web.
- Connected through a network of underground and underwater cables all over the world.
- Computers can be connected both with a wireless and wired connection using technology such as DSL, ethernet, and cable modems.

### Protocol

- A protocol is a procedure for communication between computers.

### Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

- IP is the protocol for daya being physically sent between computers.
- TCP is the protocol for ensuring data sent via IP is done without error.
- These make up the foundational protocols for communication that other protocols build off of to send information.

### Packets

- How data is sent.
- Consists of:
1. The data being sent.
2. The address of its destination.
3. The return address of the sender.
- Since one packet can only hold so much information, data is typically split into multiple packets and sent individually, and then reassembled once its reached its location.

### IP Address

- Like your house, apartment, etc, every computer has its own identifying address for sending and receiving data and information.
- Typically a series of numbers separated by dots.

### Domain Name

- Essentially an IP Address given a name for the convenience of humans (names are easier to remember than a series of numbers).
- Domain names need to be translated to their respective IP address for data to be sent and received, which is done by domain name servers.

### Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

- An example of a protocol that uses TCP/IP as its foundation.
- Used by email services to send and receive emails between computers.

### World Wide Web

- Allows you to request pages of data that are stored on computers (web servers) on the internet.
- Pages can contain information in the form of audio, text, video, images, etc.

### Web Server

- A computer connected to the internet where pages of information are stored locally to be viewed by ohers on the web.

### Web Page

- A file containing information that is stored on a web server.
- An example would be this page you are reading right now.

### Web Browser

- A user interface that llows the everyday person to search for and access web pages on their computers.
- Examples include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.

### HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

- The protocol browsers use to retrieve web pages and display them on your computer.

### Applets

- A small program that runs on a webpage. No longer used as modern replacements have been developed.

### Internet and Java

- In the past, Java was used to develop applets.
- Java is used to write complex applications, primarily network-related, such as web server softwares.
- Java has great support for network protocols.
