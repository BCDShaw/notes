## Fundamental Building Blocks of Programs

### Data and Instructions

- Two basic aspects of programming.
- Data: variables and types.
- Instructions: control structures and subroutines.

### Variables

- Variables are memory locations given a name by the programmer to be referred to in the program itself.

### Types

- Indicates what sort of data a variable can hold.
- Consists of data types such as integers, floating point numbers, strings, characters, and more.

### Assignment Statements

- Sets or resets the value stored in a variable.

##### Example:

![Example of an Assignment Statement](/images/assignment-statement-example.jpg)

This multiples the value stored inside the variable "principal" by 0.7, then stores the resulting value inside the variable "interest".

### Input Commands and Output Commands

- Input commands involve receiving data from users and files stored on the computer.
- Output commands involve sending data to users and files stored on the computer.

### Control Strucures

- Instructions that change the flow of control from linear and sequential.
- Includes loops and branches.

### Loops

- Allows a sequence of instructions to be repeated.
- Useful for when the same task needs to be performed more than once.

### Branches

- Allows the computer to decide the next course of action based on conditions that may or may not have been met.

##### Example:

![Example of a Branch Control Structure](/images/branch-example.jpg)

In this case if the value stored inside the variable "principal" is greater than 10000, "principal" will be multiplied by 0.5 and stored inside variable "interest". Otherwise, "principal" will be multiplied by 0.4 and stored inside variable "interest".

### Subroutine

- Allows us to break larger projects into manageable chunks.
- A set of instructions that have been grouped together and given a name. Only the name needs to be referred to in order for these instructions to be carried out. This greatly saves time by avoiding having to write out the same instructions over and over, and reducing the chances of human error.
- A method for organizing our code.
